## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Use tabs over Dash Pages to preserve dcc.Store cross-tab state
- [Roadmap]: Load data.xlsx once at module startup as immutable DataFrames — never inside callbacks
- [Roadmap]: Hybrid builder is Phase 4 (depends on proven chart rendering from Phase 3)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 4 (Hybrid Builder) flagged for targeted pre-planning research on dcc.Store slot schema and completion gate pattern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research flag]: data.xlsx actual column names, data types, and merged cells need verification before writing data/loader.py (Phase 1)
- [Research flag]: Miscellaneous sheet part categorization by process stage needs verification before designing slot dropdowns (Phase 4)
- [Research flag]: Cost-over-time formula needs confirmation against data.xlsx structure before implementing calculations.py (Phase 1/3)
