# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Wind-Powered Desalination Dashboard
**Audited:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** tech_debt (all requirements satisfied, no critical blockers, accumulated human verification items and minor cleanup)

## Executive Summary

All 25 v1 requirements are satisfied across all 5 phases. All phase verifications pass with no critical gaps. Cross-phase integration is fully wired — 25/25 requirement paths traced through the import/callback chain with no missing connections. All 4 E2E user flows complete end-to-end. Tech debt consists primarily of browser-interaction verification items (expected for a UI-heavy Dash app) and 4 minor orphaned imports.

## Phase Verification Summary (5/5)

| Phase | Status | Score | Critical Gaps | Human Items |
|-------|--------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| 01 Foundation | human_needed | 8/8 automated | 0 | 2 |
| 02 System Selection | human_needed | 5/5 truths | 0 | 5 |
| 03 Charts & Slider | passed | 5/5 truths | 0 | 5 |
| 04 Hybrid Builder | passed | 11/11 truths | 0 | 4 |
| 05 Polish & Deploy | human_needed | 5/6 truths | 0 | 2 |

All phases have passing automated verification. Human items are browser-interaction confirmations expected for a UI-heavy Dash application.

## Cross-Phase Integration (25/25 wired)

### Wiring Summary

- **Connected exports:** 22 cross-phase symbols imported and called
- **Orphaned imports:** 3 (fmt_num, interpolate_battery_cost, PROCESS_STAGES in layout files)
- **Intentionally unused:** 1 (SYSTEM_COLORS in shell.py per developer comment)
- **Missing connections:** 0
- **Circular imports:** None (deferred imports in render_content break potential cycles)

### Store Propagation

| Store | Writers | Consumers | Status |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| active-system | 3 (card, tab, breadcrumb) | 1 (render_content) | Correct |
| store-hybrid-slots | 1 (update_slot_store) | 6 (counter, scorecard, gate, equipment, charts, clear cascade) | Correct |

### set_data() Injection

All 4 module-level `_data` variables populated in app.py before callbacks fire:
- shell.set_data(DATA)
- charts.set_data(DATA)
- scorecard.set_data(DATA)
- hybrid_builder.set_data(DATA)

## Tech Debt Summary

### Human Verification Items (18 total)

Browser-interaction confirmations across all 5 phases. These are expected for a UI-heavy Dash application and do not represent missing functionality. Several were already confirmed by the user during execution checkpoints.

| Phase | Count | Key Items |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 01 Foundation | 2 | Browser auto-open, error page rendering |
| 02 System Selection | 5 | Card nav, tab switching, accordion, RAG dots, breadcrumb |
| 03 Charts & Slider | 5 | Slider animation, cross-chart update, legend toggle, tooltips, responsive |
| 04 Hybrid Builder | 4 | Gate overlay, re-engagement, dropdown persistence, accordion |
| 05 Polish & Deploy | 2 | 30-sec comprehension (user confirmed), print preview |

### Code Quality (4 items)

1. `fmt_num` imported but unused in equipment_grid.py
2. `interpolate_battery_cost` imported but unused in charts.py (called internally via compute_chart_data)
3. `PROCESS_STAGES` imported but unused in equipment_grid.py (delegated to get_equipment_stage)
4. `SYSTEM_COLORS` imported but unused in shell.py (intentional per comment)

### Documentation (2 items)

1. Missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter in 02-02-SUMMARY.md
2. Missing `requirements-completed` frontmatter in 04-01-SUMMARY.md

### Architectural (1 item)

1. Conditional DOM: hybrid-gate-overlay and hybrid-equipment-container callbacks fire on all tabs but only exist in DOM on hybrid tab. Safe via suppress_callback_exceptions=True. Minor UX edge on tab switching.
