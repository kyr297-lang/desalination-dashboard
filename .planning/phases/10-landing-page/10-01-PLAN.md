<objective>
Add a compact project introduction card to the top of the Overview tab so students immediately know who built this dashboard and why, before they interact with the system cards.

Purpose: Satisfy LAND-01 (intro section present), LAND-02 (four contributor names), and LAND-03 (course context) in a single, self-contained layout change.
Output: One modified Python file — `src/layout/overview.py`.

<!-- Key types and contracts the executor needs. Extracted from codebase. -->

From src/config.py:
```python
SYSTEM_COLORS = {
    "Mechanical": "#5B8DB8",   # muted steel blue
    "Electrical": "#D4854A",   # muted terra cotta / burnt orange
    "Hybrid":     "#6BAA75",   # muted sage green
}
```

From src/layout/overview.py — create_overview_layout() current structure:
```python
def create_overview_layout() -> html.Div:
    # ... builds cards list from _SYSTEM_CARDS ...
    return html.Div(
        [
            html.P(
                "Start by clicking Explore on any system card below to compare "
                "desalination system costs, land use, and energy requirements.",
                className="text-muted mb-3",
            ),
            dbc.Row(cards, className="g-3"),
        ]
    )
```

Established Bootstrap patterns in this project:
- `dbc.Card`, `dbc.CardHeader`, `dbc.CardBody`
- `className="shadow-sm"` — matches system card shadow style
- `className="text-muted small"` — muted secondary text
- `className="mb-3"` — bottom margin before the card row

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add intro card to create_overview_layout()</name>
  <files>src/layout/overview.py</files>
  <action>
Modify `create_overview_layout()` in `src/layout/overview.py` to prepend a project introduction card above the system selection cards.

**Design constraints (from CONTEXT.md):**
- Use `dbc.Card` to frame the intro section — matches the card-based layout
- Full width (no `dbc.Col` width restriction — let it span the full row)
- Compact enough that system cards are visible without scrolling on a typical screen
- Display all four names: Amogh Herle, Sofia Ijazi, Kevin Ren, Kyler Sanders (names only, no roles or links)
- Identify the course context: Fall 2025–Spring 2026 senior design class
- Card header accent color, shadow, tone, and exact wording are at Claude's discretion
- The existing "Start by clicking Explore…" instruction text may be absorbed into the card or removed — do not leave it as a duplicate

**Implementation:**

Step 1: Build the intro card. Use a neutral card header (no system color — this card is above all system cards and should not compete with them). Use `shadow-sm` to match the system cards' elevation. Keep the body to 2-4 short sentences maximum.

Example structure (wording and exact styling at your discretion):
```python
intro_card = dbc.Card(
    [
        dbc.CardHeader(
            "About This Project",
            style={"fontWeight": "600"},
        ),
        dbc.CardBody(
            [
                html.P(
                    "This dashboard was built as part of a Fall 2025–Spring 2026 "
                    "senior design class to help students compare wind-powered "
                    "desalination system configurations.",
                    className="mb-2 small",
                ),
                html.P(
                    [
                        html.Span("Contributors: ", className="fw-semibold"),
                        "Amogh Herle, Sofia Ijazi, Kevin Ren, Kyler Sanders",
                    ],
                    className="mb-0 small text-muted",
                ),
            ]
        ),
    ],
    className="mb-3 shadow-sm",
)
```

Step 2: Update the `return` statement in `create_overview_layout()` to place `intro_card` first, followed by the system card row. Remove (or absorb into the card body) the standalone `html.P` instruction text so it is not duplicated.

Final return structure:
```python
return html.Div(
    [
        intro_card,
        dbc.Row(cards, className="g-3"),
    ]
)
```

**Do NOT:**
- Modify `_SYSTEM_CARDS` or the system card building loop
- Add any new imports beyond what is already in the file (`dbc`, `html`, `SYSTEM_COLORS` are all present)
- Change callbacks or any other file
- Use `SYSTEM_COLORS` for the intro card header (it must remain neutral / not system-specific)

  <what-built>
    A project introduction card prepended to the Overview tab layout. The card shows a brief project description, the Fall 2025–Spring 2026 senior design course context, and all four contributor names (Amogh Herle, Sofia Ijazi, Kevin Ren, Kyler Sanders).

    1. Start the app: `python app.py` from the project root
    2. Open the browser at http://127.0.0.1:8050 (or configured port)
    3. Confirm the Overview tab is the initial view (no system selected)
    4. Verify the intro card appears at the top — above the three system cards
    5. Verify the card contains all four contributor names
    6. Verify the card mentions the Fall 2025–Spring 2026 senior design course context
    7. Confirm the three system cards (Mechanical, Electrical, Hybrid) are visible below without scrolling on a normal desktop window
    8. Navigate to a system page (click Explore on any card) and back — confirm the intro card is still present on return to Overview
    9. Confirm the app loads without any errors in the terminal

3. The section identifies the course context as Fall 2025–Spring 2026 senior design class (LAND-03)
4. The intro card is full-width and compact — system cards remain visible without scrolling on a typical desktop
